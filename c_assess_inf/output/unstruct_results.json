This is the basis for how screens and digital displays work.\n* **Perception:**  Color perception is subjective, and different people may perceive colors differently. \n\nSo, while red, yellow, and blue are a common answer, it's important to consider the context and the specific definition of \"main colors\" you're looking for."

It also comes with the opportunity to learn from experienced mentors and build a strong network within the tech industry. However, the move would mean leaving behind her support system and starting fresh in a new environment.\n\nSarah's dilemma is a classic example of a trade-off.
