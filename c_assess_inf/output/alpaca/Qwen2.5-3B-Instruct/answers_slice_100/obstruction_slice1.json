Sure! The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. As the pressure increases, the boiling point also increases. This means that under higher pressure, water will need to reach a higher temperature before it starts to boil. For example, at high altitudes where the air pressure is lower",
