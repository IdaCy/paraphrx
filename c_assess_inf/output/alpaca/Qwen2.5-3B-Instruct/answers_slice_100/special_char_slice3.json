Initial Equilibrium: The initial equilibrium price and quantity are determined by the intersection of the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D).\n\n2.

In thermodynamics, it is a state function that describes the amount of energy in a system that is not available to do work. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. This means that natural processes tend to move towards a state of higher entropy, or disorder, and away from a state of lower entropy, or order. Entropy is often associated with heat transfer and the direction of spontaneous processes.
