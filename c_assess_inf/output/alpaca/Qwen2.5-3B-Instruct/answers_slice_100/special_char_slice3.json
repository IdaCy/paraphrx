In other words, as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied of that good also increases, assuming all other factors remain constant. This principle can be explained through several key points:\n\n1. Higher prices incentivize producers to supply more goods: When the price of a good rises, it becomes more profitable for producers to sell that good. As a result, they are willing and able to produce and supply a greater quantity of that good in the market.\n\n2. Producers adjust their",

This is because the increased demand puts upward pressure on the price, while the unchanged supply creates a shortage at the original price level. To eliminate this shortage, the price will have to rise until it reaches a new equilibrium where the quantity supplied equals the quantity",
