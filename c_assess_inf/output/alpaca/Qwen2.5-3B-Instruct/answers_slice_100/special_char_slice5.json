It is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. Each internal node of the tree represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g., whether a coin lands heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (outcome). Decision trees are used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification tasks, the goal is to predict the category of a given input, while in regression tasks",
