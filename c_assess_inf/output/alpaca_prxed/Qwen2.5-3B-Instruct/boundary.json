In thermodynamics, it is a fundamental concept that quantifies the degree of energy dispersal within a system. The higher the entropy, the more evenly distributed the energy is among the particles in the system, leading to a state of greater disorder. Conversely, lower entropy indicates a more ordered system with energy concentrated in fewer areas. \n\nIn the context of the conceptual diagram, entropy can be visualized as the spread of energy particles across different levels or states, with the most dispersed state having the highest entropy.
