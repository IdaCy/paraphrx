This is the basis for how screens and digital displays work.\n* **Perception:**  Color perception is subjective, and different people may perceive colors differently. \n\nSo, while red, yellow, and blue are a common answer, it's important to consider the context and the specific definition of \"main colors\" you're looking for."
