It can generate text quickly and accurately by using large datasets, which can be used for natural language processing tasks such as summarization, question-answering, and text generation. GPT models are also scaleable, meaning they are able to process complex tasks with minimal resources. They are fast and require no human effort to train, which makes them useful for quickly generating results in various tasks where manual work may be too expensive or slow. Additionally, GPT models are highly flexible, allowing developers to easily adjust the output according to their own preferences. In short, GPT models are an efficient and cost-effective way to generate text.",

It is able to accurately parse and manipulate text, but it is limited in its accuracy and speed. Deep learning based text processing uses algorithms to learn from datasets and extract patterns from text. It is able to process text with high accuracy and at a much faster rate than rule-based text processing. Deep learning models are also more flexible and can be adapted to different tasks with little effort. Deep learning is thus better suited for more complex text processing tasks.",

We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense!
