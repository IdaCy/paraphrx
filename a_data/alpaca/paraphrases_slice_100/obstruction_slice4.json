GPT models are also scaleable, meaning they are able to process complex tasks with minimal resources. They are fast and require no human effort to train, which makes them useful for quickly generating results in various tasks where manual work may be too expensive or slow. Additionally, GPT models are highly flexible, allowing developers to easily adjust the output according to their own preferences.

It is causing higher temperatures across the globe, extreme weather changes such as flooding and drought, and an increase in sea levels. In addition to these physical effects, climate change also has an emotional impact. It causes anxiety and stress, due to the worry of the unknown and the potential destruction it could cause. Finally, it is disproportionately affecting low-income households, which don't have the resources to access clean energy and adapt to the changing environment.",

These elements and attributes define the content and any visual element that appear on a page. CSS is used to modify and enhance the visual appearance of the page. It contains a set of values assigned to elements, attributes and properties that control the presentation of the page. These include layout, color, font, and animation. CSS allows for more flexibility when styling a page. Therefore, HTML defines the structure and content of a website while CSS is used to design it and make it look attractive.",

    "output": "It’s been one year since the coronavirus pandemic began to affect the lives of people around the world. In the midst of massive lockdowns and social distancing, we managed to learn a few things about this virus. For starters, it is apparently very contagious, as it spread like wildfire around the globe. We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense! We may never know the answer, but at least we can attempt to stay safe and healthy.",
