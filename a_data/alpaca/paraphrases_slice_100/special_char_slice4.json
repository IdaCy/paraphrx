This enables musicians to quickly work out the relationships between the different key signatures, which can be helpful in composition and arranging music.",

It is able to accurately parse and manipulate text, but it is limited in its accuracy and speed. Deep learning based text processing uses algorithms to learn from datasets and extract patterns from text. It is able to process text with high accuracy and at a much faster rate than rule-based text processing. Deep learning models are also more flexible and can be adapted to different tasks with little effort. Deep learning is thus better suited for more complex text processing tasks.",

AI solutions are enabling hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers to provide more precise and personalized care to their patients. AI solutions are being used to automate mundane tasks such as data collection and analysis, thus freeing up resources for other more important tasks. AI solutions are also being used to provide predictive insights on a patient’s health and detect diseases in a timely manner. AI-driven technologies have been particularly useful in diagnosing diseases such as cancer by recognizing patterns from medical images. AI-enabled robotic surgeries can also provide precise and minimally invasive procedures for patients. All in all, AI is changing the way healthcare is delivered and allowing medical practitioners to provide better and more efficient care to their patients.",

In the midst of massive lockdowns and social distancing, we managed to learn a few things about this virus. For starters, it is apparently very contagious, as it spread like wildfire around the globe. We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense! We may never know the answer, but at least we can attempt to stay safe and healthy.",

It spreads primarily through close contact with an infected person, through small droplets from the nose or mouth after coughing or sneezing. Symptoms can include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. In severe cases, it can cause difficulty breathing, pneumonia, kidney failure, and even death.",
