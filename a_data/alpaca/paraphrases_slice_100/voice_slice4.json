It is a potent reminder that we can never forget the inequalities around us, nor take for granted the privileges we have. This deep exploration of class division and moral complexities make Parasite a must-see and worthy inclusion in any top 10 list.",

In the midst of massive lockdowns and social distancing, we managed to learn a few things about this virus. For starters, it is apparently very contagious, as it spread like wildfire around the globe. We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense! We may never know the answer, but at least we can attempt to stay safe and healthy.",
